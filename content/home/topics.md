In the NLP, CL, and IR communities, Arabic is considered to be relatively resource-poor compared to English. This situation was thought to be the reason for the limited number of corpus-based studies in Arabic. However, the past years witnessed the emergence of new considerably free Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) corpora and to a lesser extent Arabic processing tools. <br><br>
This workshop follows the footsteps of previous editions of OSACT to provide a forum for researchers to share and discuss their ongoing work. This workshop is timely given the continued rise in research projects focusing on Arabic Language Resources. <br><br>
<i>Language Resources:</i><br>

<li> Pre-trained Arabic language models and their applications. </li>
<li> Surveying and evaluating the design of available Arabic corpora, their associated and processing tools. </li>
<li> Availing new annotated corpora for NLP and IR applications such as named entity recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, and language learning. </li>
<li> Evaluating the use of crowdsourcing platforms for Arabic data annotation. </li>
<li> Open source Arabic processing toolkits. </li>
<br>
<i> Tools and Technologies: </i> <br>

<li>Language education, e.g., L1 and L2.</li>
<li>Language modeling and pre-trained models.</li>
<li>Tokenization, normalization, word segmentation, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, etc. </li>
<li>Sentiment analysis, dialect identification, and text classification</li>
<li>Dialect translation</li>
<li>Fake news detection</li>
<li>Web and social media search and analytics</li>
<li>Issues in the design, construction and use of Arabic LRs: text, speech, sign, gesture, image, in single or multimodal/multimedia data</li>
<li>Guidelines, standards, best practices and models for LRs interoperability</li>
<li>Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation</li>
<li>Methodologies and tools for extraction and acquisition of knowledge</li>
<li>Ontologies, terminology and knowledge representation</li>
<li>LRs and Semantic Web (including Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs, etc.)</li>
