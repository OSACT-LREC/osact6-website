The workshop will also give special attention on Multilingualism and Language Technology for All, which is one of LREC 2022 hot topics. In addition to the general topics of CL, NLP and IR, the workshop will give a special emphasis on two shared tasks, namely: Quran QA and Fine-Grained Hate Speech Detection.</font></p>
