            <p class="lead"><font size = "4">In the computational linguistics (CL), natural language processing (NLP), and information retrieval (IR) communities, Arabic is considered to be relatively resource-poor compared to English. This situation was thought to be the reason for the limited number of language resources -based studies in Arabic. However, the past few years witnessed the emergence of new considerably large and free classical and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) as well as dialectical corpora and to a lesser extent Arabic processing tools. <br><br>
This workshop follows the footsteps of previous editions of OSACT to provide a forum for researchers to share and discuss their ongoing work. This workshop is timely given the continued rise in research projects focusing on Arabic Language Resources. The sixth workshop comes to encourage researchers and practitioners of Arabic language technologies, including CL, NLP and IR to share and discuss their latest research efforts, corpora, and tools. The workshop will also give special attention to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, which is a hot topic nowadays.
