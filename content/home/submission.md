            The language of the workshop is English and submissions should be with respect to LREC 2024 paper submission instructions (<a href="https://lrec-coling-2024.org/authors-kit/">https://lrec-coling-2024.org/authors-kit/</a>). All papers will be peer reviewed, possibly by three independent referees.  Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format to the START system. <br><br>
When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. <br><br>
Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including evaluation ones).
