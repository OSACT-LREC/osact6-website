  <p>OSACT6 invites high-quality submissions written in English. Submissions of two forms of papers will be considered:</p>

  <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Regular long papers –</strong> up to eight (8) pages maximum*, presenting substantial, original, completed,
            and unpublished work.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Short papers –</strong> up to four (4) pages*, describing a small focused contribution, negative results,
            system demonstrations, etc.
        </li>
    </ol>

  <p>* Excluding any number of additional pages for references, ethical consideration, conflict-of-interest, as well as data,
        and code availability statements.</p>

  <p>Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page – up to nine (9) pages of content plus
        unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references – so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Final versions
        of short papers may have up to five (5) pages, plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references. For both long and
        short papers, all figures and tables that are part of the main text must fit within these page limits.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, appendices or supplementary material will also be allowed ONLY in the final, camera-ready version, but not
        during submission, as papers should be reviewed without the need to refer to any supplementary materials.</p>

  <p>Linguistic examples, if any, should be presented in the original language but also glossed into English to allow
        accessibility for a broader audience.</p>

  <p>Note that paper types are decisions made orthogonal to the eventual, final form of presentation (i.e., oral versus
        poster).</p>
