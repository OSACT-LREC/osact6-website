            <h3><font size = "5"> Task 2: Dialect to MSA Machine Translation (estimated number of participants 25)</font></h3>
            <br>
            The Dialect to MSA (Modern Standard Arabic) Machine Translation Shared Task offers an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to tackle the intricate challenge of translating various Arabic dialects into Modern Standard Arabic. With the rich linguistic diversity across Arabic-speaking regions, this task aims to advance machine translation capabilities and bridge the gap between colloquial spoken Arabic and the formal written language. Participants will work on developing and refining translation models that can accurately and fluently convert dialectal Arabic text into MSA, making it a crucial initiative for improving communication and comprehension in the Arabic-speaking world.
