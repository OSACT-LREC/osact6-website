        <b>Title: </b><br>A proposal to accelerate innovation for Arabic Speech and Language Processing<br><br>
        <b>Abstract:</b><br>
        The innovation rate for Arabic Speech and Language Processing in the last 20 years has steadily been increasing, leading to technologies achieving great results. Yet, there are challenges that need to be addressed to improve the speed even further. This starts with resources (across data, tools, and people), alignment over tasks (task definition, metrics and benchmarks), and broad engagement of diverse stakeholders (academia, industry and policy makers). Hassan will give a brief reflection over his past work on Arabic Speech and Language Processing and will suggest ways for the community to engage with each other to push innovation much further.
